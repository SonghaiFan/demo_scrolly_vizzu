      <h1>The Golden Age of Vinyl üìÄ</h1>
      <p>
        In the 1970s, vinyl records dominated the music industry. With their
        warm, analog sound and large album artwork, vinyl records became the
        primary format for music consumption. The format's popularity peaked in
        the late 1970s, with artists like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and The
        Beatles releasing their most iconic albums on vinyl. However, the
        introduction of new formats would soon challenge vinyl's dominance.

            The 1970s marked the peak of vinyl dominance. With revenue reaching
            over $10 billion annually, vinyl records were the undisputed king of
            music formats. The format's success was driven by its superior sound
            quality and the cultural significance of album artwork and liner
            notes.

            As we move into the 1980s, we see the rise of cassette tapes and the
            introduction of CDs. Cassettes offered portability and the ability
            to record, while CDs promised digital clarity and durability. This
            period marked the beginning of vinyl's decline.

        <div class="step" data-step-id="step3">

            The 1990s saw CDs become the dominant format, with vinyl sales
            plummeting to near zero. The digital revolution was in full swing,
            and the music industry was adapting to new consumer preferences for
            convenience and portability.

            formats. The music industry was entering a period of unprecedented
            transformation.

            streaming's convenience. Today, we see an interesting coexistence
            where digital streaming dominates while vinyl experiences a
            nostalgic revival.

      <h1>The Digital Revolution üíø</h1>
      <p>
        The introduction of the Compact Disc (CD) in 1982 marked the beginning
        of the digital music era. CDs offered superior sound quality,
        durability, and the ability to skip tracks instantly. This new format
        would eventually replace both vinyl and cassette tapes as the dominant
        music format.

            The CD era began in the early 1980s and quickly gained momentum. By
            the mid-1990s, CDs had become the dominant format, with sales
            reaching over $16 billion annually. The digital revolution was

            The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of digital
            downloads. Services like iTunes and Napster changed the game,
            allowing consumers to purchase individual tracks rather than entire
            albums. This marked the beginning of the digital music revolution.

            Streaming services emerged in the late 2000s and early 2010s,
            fundamentally changing the music industry. Services like Spotify,
            Apple Music, and YouTube Music offered unlimited access to vast
            libraries of music for a monthly subscription fee.

      <h1>The Streaming Era & Vinyl's Comeback üéµ</h1>
      <p>
        The 2010s marked the rise of streaming services and an unexpected
        resurgence of vinyl records. While streaming became the dominant format,
        vinyl experienced a remarkable comeback, driven by nostalgia, superior
        sound quality, and the tactile experience of physical media. This

            The streaming revolution began in earnest in the late 2000s.
            Services like Spotify, launched in 2008, offered unlimited access to
            millions of songs for a monthly fee. This model fundamentally
            changed how people consumed music, moving from ownership to access.

            By the mid-2010s, streaming had overtaken digital downloads as the

            libraries available on mobile devices drove rapid adoption among

            by nostalgia, superior sound quality, and the tactile experience of
            physical media. By 2020, vinyl had become a significant niche
